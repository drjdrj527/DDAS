# ddas
A C program that monitors a directory for new files and detects duplicates based on their SHA-256 hash. It checks both fully and partially downloaded files (e.g., .crdownload, .part), alerts the user with a sound and notification when duplicates are found, and continuously updates hash lists in real-time.
